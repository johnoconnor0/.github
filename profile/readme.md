## About Me

I lead the design and development team at Weblifter as Managing Director and Lead Developer, where I focus on creating competitive, scalable solutions that drive real business value. With a background combining Computer Science and Economics from The University of Queensland, I bridge the gap between technical excellence and strategic business outcomes.

My expertise spans full-stack development, cloud architecture, and technical SEO, with a particular focus on delivering enterprise-grade solutions that streamline operations and reduce costs for businesses across Australia and beyond.

**Core Focus Areas:**
- Enterprise Software Architecture & Integration
- Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Firebase, Azure, GCP)
- Technical SEO & Performance Optimization
- Ecommerce Platform Development
- Project Management & Team Leadership
